# Cockpit continuity and trust state

The cockpit presents server-authorized workspace data without treating presence
as verification. Build History summaries may identify a track and its durable
status, but only `includeVerifiedPreview=true` may replace the trusted iframe and
receipt. Plain track and event reads never change the local draft or trusted
preview, and event `detail` is never rendered.

Restoring a build copies only its curated request into a new local draft. It does
not copy a track ID, creator, signer, lifecycle, origin, publication, or
idempotency authority. Viewer access is inspect-only; Maintainer and Architect
editing still results in a new server-authorized track.

All async workspace evidence uses principal/workspace generation guards.
Same-workspace domain and publication operations additionally bind the exact
claim, origin, track, version, draft, and verified-preview generation. A stale
response may not replace a newer draft, receipt, claim selection, or publication
state. Failures retain the last valid draft and verified preview while showing a
specific retry/recovery state.
